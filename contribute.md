## Branching Model

We follow the gitflow workflow.

You can learn about git-flow here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow

Since this is open source you'll need to make a fork of our repo and make your changes there.

We prefer to keep a linear history on our `develop` branch as much as possible. So we would really appreciate it if you `rebase` your branch before creating a pull request.

Why you ask? Well... https://www.bitsnbites.eu/a-tidy-linear-git-history/

## Choosing an issue

If it's your first time we'll help you pick a "good first issue"

We like to keep those issues for new contributers. So once you get the hang of things we would appreciate it if you take on harder stuff, or help others with their first issues
